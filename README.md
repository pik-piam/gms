## Purpose and Functionality

A collection of tools to create, use and maintain modularized model code written in the modeling 
    language 'GAMS' (<https://www.gams.com/>). Out-of-the-box 'GAMS' does not come with support for modularized
    model code. This package provides the tools necessary to convert a standard 'GAMS' model to a modularized one
    by introducing a modularized code structure together with a naming convention which emulates local
    environments. In addition, this package provides tools to monitor the compliance of the model code with
    modular coding guidelines.


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("gms")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```
